# Simple_Keylogger

I juste wrote a simple keylogger for Windows

I use pynput to catch user inputs.

Usage : python3 simple_keylogger.py

This will catch every input from the user until he press the escape key.
The record will be saved into a file in the same folder with a name like "[computername]_[date]_[time]_record.txt".


Feel free to use, modify and improve this script and let me know what changes you made !
